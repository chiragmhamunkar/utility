1. mongo_utility.js is utility script to connect to mongo db and perform various tasks
2. `node mongo_utility.js` this is the command to run the script.






What can be enhanced?
1. We can take DB, COLLECTION names as run arguments.
2. We can use a module to promisify funcutions instead of writing a promise by ourself. It will reduce the lines.
